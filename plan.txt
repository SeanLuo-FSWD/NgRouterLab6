Need to have a parent component that holds the movies attribute.

Number of pages has to be calculated. So if 4 movies per page, then 30/4 = 6 movies remaining. 

There should be an unified incrementable attr that is shared between nav display and what is used to calculate the pages. 

The nav link is displayed accordingly.

//

Header
Movie Page(main) : call api, holds page state(current, and calculated), filter
    Sub Nav(mnav) : page nav 
    Movie List(mlist) : display 
About Page  

//

To get movies:
